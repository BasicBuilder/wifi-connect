# WiFi Connect: 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS Compatibility Report

## Overview
This document outlines the necessary modifications to make WiFi Connect compatible with 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS (aarch64). The project already has partial support for 64-bit ARM architecture, but requires updates to ensure full compatibility with 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS.

## Current Status
Based on analysis of the codebase, WiFi Connect:
- Uses Rust as its primary programming language
- Has cross-compilation support via Cross.toml
- Includes the aarch64 target in CI workflows (flowzone.yml)
- Uses NetworkManager for WiFi management
- Has installation scripts designed primarily for 32-bit Raspberry Pi OS

## Required Changes

### 1. Build System Updates

#### Update Cross.toml
The current Cross.toml file needs to explicitly support aarch64 architecture:

```toml
[target.aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu]
image = "rustembedded/cross:aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu"
```

### 2. Installation Script Updates

#### Modify raspbian-install.sh
The current installation script (`scripts/raspbian-install.sh`) needs to be updated to:
1. Properly detect 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS
2. Download the aarch64 binary when running on 64-bit systems

```bash
# Add to check_os_version function
check_architecture() {
    local _arch=$(uname -m)
    
    if [ "$_arch" = "aarch64" ]; then
        # Running on 64-bit ARM
        ARCH="aarch64"
    elif [ "$_arch" = "armv7l" ] || [ "$_arch" = "armhf" ]; then
        # Running on 32-bit ARM
        ARCH="armv7"
    else
        err "Unsupported architecture: $_arch"
    fi
}

# Update install_wfc function to use architecture-specific download
local _regex='browser_download_url": "\K.*'$ARCH'\.tar\.gz'
```

### 3. Update Build and Release Process

#### Release Binary for aarch64
Ensure the CI/CD pipeline builds and releases binaries for the aarch64 architecture. The current configuration in `.github/workflows/flowzone.yml` includes the aarch64 target, but we should verify that:

1. The binary is properly tagged as `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`
2. The release process includes this binary in GitHub releases
3. The binary is correctly packaged with the UI files

### 4. Dependencies Considerations

#### NetworkManager Compatibility
Verify that the NetworkManager dependency works correctly on 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS:

1. Test NetworkManager installation and configuration on 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS
2. Ensure compatibility with the network-manager Rust crate on aarch64 architecture

#### DBus Compatibility
The build requires libdbus-1-dev which needs to be installed for the aarch64 architecture.

### 5. Testing Procedure

1. Install 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS on a Raspberry Pi 3 or 4
2. Test the installation script with modifications
3. Verify NetworkManager functionality
4. Test WiFi network scanning and connection
5. Verify captive portal functionality

### 6. Documentation Updates

1. Update README.md to explicitly mention 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS support
2. Add architecture-specific installation instructions
3. Update troubleshooting section with 64-bit specific considerations

## Implementation Plan

1. Modify Cross.toml for explicit aarch64 support
2. Update raspbian-install.sh to detect and support 64-bit architecture
3. Test building for aarch64 architecture locally
4. Test installation and functionality on 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS
5. Update documentation
6. Create pull request with changes

## Implemented Changes

The following changes have been implemented to ensure compatibility with 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS:

### 1. Cross.toml Updates

Added explicit support for the aarch64 architecture:

```toml
[target.aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu]
image = "rustembedded/cross:aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu"
```

### 2. Installation Script Updates

Modified `scripts/raspbian-install.sh` to:
- Detect the system architecture (32-bit vs 64-bit ARM)
- Look for aarch64 binaries when running on 64-bit systems
- Fall back to 32-bit binaries if no aarch64 binary is available
- Added error handling for unsupported architectures

### 3. Documentation Updates

Updated README.md to explicitly mention 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS support:
- Added a statement that WiFi Connect supports both 32-bit and 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS

## Conclusion

WiFi Connect appears to have the foundation needed for 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS support through its existing aarch64 target specification. The main changes required are in the installation script to properly detect and use the correct binary for 64-bit systems, and thorough testing on actual 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS installations to ensure compatibility. 

## Next Steps

After implementing these changes, it's recommended to:
1. Test the modified installation script on a 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS system
2. Verify that the appropriate binary is downloaded and installed
3. Confirm that WiFi Connect functions correctly on 64-bit systems
4. Create proper release builds that include the aarch64 binary
